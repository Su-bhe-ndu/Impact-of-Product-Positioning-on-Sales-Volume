# Impact-of-Product-Positioning-on-Sales-Volume

In today's competitive retail environment, understanding the factors that influence sales volume is crucial for maximizing revenue and ensuring business success. One of the key factors that can significantly impact sales is product positioning within a store. This project aims to explore and quantify the effect of product positioning on sales volume, utilizing various data fields such as product price, competitor's price, promotional activities, foot traffic, consumer demographics, product category, and seasonality.

The dataset encompasses diverse products and includes the following fields: Product ID, Product Position, Price, Competitor's Price, Promotion, Foot Traffic, Consumer Demographics, Product Category, Seasonal, and Sales Volume. By analyzing these variables, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform strategic decisions about product placement.

To achieve this goal, the project involves several key steps:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initially, we conduct EDA to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and detect any anomalies or outliers. This step provides a foundation for more in-depth analysis and helps in formulating hypotheses.

2) Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA Test): To determine if product positioning significantly affects sales volume, we perform hypothesis testing using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). This statistical test helps in assessing whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of sales volumes across different product positions (e.g., aisle vs. end-cap).

3) Predictive Modeling: Finally, we build a predictive model to forecast sales volume based on the identified factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can predict sales volume with high accuracy, providing actionable insights for optimizing product positioning strategies.

Through this comprehensive analysis, the project seeks to provide a deeper understanding of how product positioning influences sales and offer data-driven recommendations for enhancing retail performance.
